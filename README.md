# hello world ðŸ‘‹

- this is my compiled material for SC-900 prep of all main points list on [Study guide for Exam SC-900: Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/sc-900) using Colipot and Gemini.
- IMO best used with John Savill's cramp course - [SC-900 Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals Study Cram V2](https://youtu.be/-FJqb60wPSY?si=wQgqxADXqz1Nmxqg)
    - thank you John!
- upload time: Oct-3rd 2024
- as of now there will be a course on Coursera that will give you 50% voucher for the cert: [Microsoft Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/microsoft-cybersecurity-analyst)

good luck everyone!
